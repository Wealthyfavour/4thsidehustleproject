            <p> Welcome to my homepage! I am Favour Kaka, Director of Wealtech, a frontend developer who is passionate about creating beautiful
            <br>  and functional websites and applications.</p>
            <p><br> As a frontend developer, I specialize in building the parts of a website or application that users interact with directly. This includes
            <br> the design, layout, and user interface, as well as the functionality that makes everything work seamlessly.</p>
            <br> What sets me apart as a frontend developer is my attention to detail and my focus on user experience. I strive to create websites
            <br>  and applications that are not only visually appealing but also easy to use and navigate. </p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p><h5>
              <p> As a frontend developer, I am a professional who specializes in building the user-facing part of a website or application responsible 
            <br> for creating the visual design, layout, and user interface that users interact with directly. </p>
             
                 To do this,  I use a combination of programming languages and technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I create designs that 
            <br> are visually appealing and easy to use, while also ensuring that the website or application is accessible and inclusive for all users. <p>
            <br> I work independently or as part of a team, collaborating with designers, backend developers, and other stakeholders to bring a project 
            <br> to life. I work for a wide range of organizations, including software companies, digital agencies, and startups.
